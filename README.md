# TextBasedGame
A crude attempt upon learning the language, the python based game is played entirely via text input. It is an attempt to recreate Zork, an early text based game, and if taken forward is intended to be a sandbox game for, but limited to, the blind.
1. The game is entirely played via text input
2. The instructions to play the game have been mentioned at the start of the game as clearly as possible. 
3. Further one might try to 'take' objects by adding 'take' before the object name. ex 'take key'
4. No extra modules will be needed to run the file. 

For anyone who attempts to play the game, this was my 1st semester project in College so its not very complex and even requires a lot of refining but hope it made you smile a little :)
